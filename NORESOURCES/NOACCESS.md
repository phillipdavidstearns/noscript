# NØ ACCESS

Configure your Raspberry Pi to act as a wireless access point and serve up a captive portal. The Raspberry Pi can host a fully website complete with javascript, php, and any content that can be stored on the available space of the micro SD card.

Hosting everything locally means that we will be able to access the content from the WiFi access point we create, even though the Pi itself may not be connected to the internet.

You should think of this as a WiFi accessible, offline website.

This creates the possibility for local WiFi publishing, WiFi dead drops, mobile net art galleries, etc...

## Agenda


* Install tools
* Distribute WiFi dongles
* Configure tools
* Launch AP
* Create serve up captive portal

### Requirements:

* `hostapd` - used to create a wireless access point. 
* `dnsmasq` - a lightweight framework for providing network infrastructure, namely Domain Name Service (DNS), and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
* `nginx` - a lightweight web server 

*resources:*

* [Setting up a Raspberry Pi as an access point in a standalone network (NAT)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md)
* [Raspberry Pi Access Point and Captive Portal](https://brennanhm.ca/knowledgebase/2016/10/raspberry-pi-access-point-and-captive-portal-without-internet/)

## Install Tools:

### 1. packages

To save a bit of time, we'll update the apt-get package list, skip the upgrade, and install `hotapd` and `dnsmasq`. Run the following commands to do this:


```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq nginx
```

### 2. Hardware


The PAU05 is a usb wifi dongle that supports assess point and monitor mode. Not all adapters have this capability and is something that requires a bit of additional research when shopping for other (more powerful) adapters.

Before plugging the dongle in, run:

```
$ ip a
```

This list the available network devices. `wlan0` is the current wireless interface. Anyways, plug this dongle into any of the USB ports. Run `$ ip a` again and you'll find there's a new device: `wlan1`. 

Write down the MAC address. You can find is after "link/ether", for example:

```
link/ether 9c:ef:d5:fc:30:1a
```

### 3. Predictable Network Interface Names

Depending on the boot sequence, the dongle and onboard wireless adapters might switch unpredictably between `wlan0` and `wlan1`. To assign a stable network device name to the dongle, we need to enable Predictable Network Interface Names:

1. run `$ sudo raspi-config`
2. select option 2, "Network Options" and press enter
3. select option N3, "Network interface names" and press enter
4. select "Yes" and press enter
5. Reboot

Now when you log back in and run `$ ip a`, we should see `wlan0`, and an interface with a unique id. My wifi dongle's name is now `wlx9cefd5fc3019`. The unique ID is based on the device's MAC. Check your MAC address to confirm.

*Make sure to write this down for the next steps!*

### 4. Create a hostname for hotspot network

When a host connects to our access point, it's nice if its IP address resolves to a host name. To configure this we need to edit the `/etc/hosts` file:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

and add the following line

```
192.168.42.1	localnet
```

The name can be anything we want and you can change this in the future. For now, we simply want a user-friendly name, `localnet` to take the place of something like `192.168.42.1`.

## Configure Tools:

### 1. Stop `hostapd` & `dnsmasq` services

First, let's check the status of the services we just installed: `hostapd` and `dnsmasq`. We can check the status of a service by using the `systemctl` command with the `status` option:

```
$ sudo systemctl status hostapd
```

If you get the output:

```
● hostapd.service
	Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit hostapd.service is masked.)
	Active: inactive (dead)
```

run:

```
$ sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
$ sudo systemctl enable hostapd
```

Checking the status again should give us:

```
● hostapd.service - Advanced IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator
	Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/hostapd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
	Active: inactive (dead)
```

This is what we want.

If `status` displays "Active: active", run:

```
$ sudo systemctl stop hostapd
```

Then run:

```
$ sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
```

Both `hostapd` and `dnsmasq` should be stopped. Check their status to confirm (optional but recommended).

```
$ sudo systemctl status hostapd
$ sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
```

### 2. Modify DHCP settings

Setup a static IP for the access point we'll run on our USB wifi dongle. This address will serve as the router IP for the access point. When you connect to the it, you'll also be able to `ssh` into this address.

```
$ sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

Add the following lines:

```
interface <your_assigned_network_device_name>
	static ip_address=192.168.42.1/24
	nohook wpa_supplicant
```
Be sure to replace `<your_assigned_network_device_name>` with your adapter's predictable name.

Save and exit.

Restart the `dhcpcd` service to apply the changes.

```
$ sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd
```

### 3. Configure `hostapd`

`hostapd` is a lightweight service that runs in the background (daemonized) and makes the Pi work like a WiFi access point. We need to give it some basic settings like name (ssid), interface, and any security settings. We're configuring an open WiFi access point. I've left WPA settings commented out so you can lock things down if you want.

#### Create a configuration file:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```

Add to it:

```

# Network Name
ssid=<choose_your_own_ssid>

# Network Region
country_code=FR

# Network Device Settings
interface=<your_assigned_network_device_name>
driver=nl80211
hw_mode=g
channel=6
ieee80211n=1
wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

#If you want to set a password for network access
#auth_algs=1
#wpa=2
#wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
#wpa_pairwise=TKIP
#rsn_pairwise=CCMP
#wpa_passphrase=NOSECRET2019
```

Be sure to change `<your_assigned_network_device_name>` to the predictable network name your Pi gave the WiFi adapter.

### 4. Tell `hostapd` where to find the configuration file:

#### Create & edit `/etc/default/hostapd`

```
$ sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
```

Find the line that reads:

```
#DAEMON_CONF=""
```

uncomment and change to:

```
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
```

#### Edit `/etc/init.d/hostapd`


```
$ sudo nano /etc/init.d/hostapd
```

find

```
DAEMON_CONF=
```

change to

```
DAEMON_CONF=/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```

### 5. Configure `dnsmasq`

Make a copy of the original configuration file:

```
$ sudo cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf{,.bak}
```

Edit the confinguration file:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```
Add:

```
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
bogus-priv
#　Add other name servers here, with domain specs if they are for　non-public domains.
server=/localnet/192.168.42.1
# Add local-only domains here, queries in these domains are answered　from /etc/hosts or DHCP only.
local=/localnet/
# Make all host names resolve to the Raspberry Pi's IP address
address=/#/192.168.42.1
# Specify the interface that will listen for DHCP and DNS requests
interface=<your_assigned_network_device_name>
# Set the domain for dnsmasq
domain=localnet
# Specify the range of IP addresses the DHCP server will lease out to devices, and the duration of the lease
dhcp-range=192.168.42.5,192.168.42.250,2h
# Specify the default route
dhcp-option=3,192.168.42.1
# Specify the DNS server address
dhcp-option=6,192.168.42.1
# Set the DHCP server to authoritative mode.
dhcp-authoritative
```
Be sure to change `<your_assigned_network_device_name>` to the predictable network name your Pi gave the WiFi adapter.

### 6. Start `hostapd` and `dnsmasq`

#### `hostapd`

We're ready to launch our access point!

```
$ sudo systemctl start hostapd
```

This might fail, but it could be because of other system services running. We'll reboot after starting dnsmasq, then check the service status again.

#### `dnsmasq`

```
$ sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
```
<!-- 

Might have to revise dnsmasq configuration

### 7. Create a basic portal page

<!--
Create a directory to put the portal page files in:

```
$ sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/html/captive-portal --mode=u+rwx,g+srw,o-w
```

Change the owner to `nostudent:www-data` to allow for sudo-less editing

```
$ sudo chown nostudent:www-data -R /usr/share/nginx/html
```
-->

Make a backup of the default `nginx` `index.html` page. You can replace this page with custom html and javascript later. This is just a place holder to indicate that the setup worked.

```
$ sudo cp /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html{,.bak}
```

Create the portal page (draft) in a fresh `index.html` page:

```
$ sudo echo "<h1>Hello</h1>" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```
<!--
Connect to your access point and navigate to `test.com`. You should be redirected to the default `nginx` page.
-->

### 8. Configure `nginx`

Create a configuration file for the captive portal.

```
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/captive-portal.conf
```

Copy this basic configuration into it:

```
server {
	# Listen for requests over both HTTP and HTTPS
	listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;
	
	# Present a friendly name to the client, instead of an IP address
	server_name localnet;

	# Tell nginx where the root directory of the website is located
	root /usr/share/nginx/html;

	index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

	# Redirect requests for /generate_204 to open the captive portal screen
	location /generate_204 {
		return 302 http://localnet/index.html;
	}

	# Redirect requests for files that don't exist to the captive-portal page
	location / {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
	}
}
```

Press controll+x, y, enter to save.

Create a symbolic link to the configuration file:

```
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/captive-portal.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/captive-portal.conf
```

Remove the symbolic link to the default from the `sites-enabled` folder:

```
$ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

We're now ready to reboot and see if it worked!

```
$ sudo reboot
```

### 9. Connect

Connect to your open access point and see if your captive portal page pops up automatically.
